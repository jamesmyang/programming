The filepath name needs to end with \".weights.h5\" when save_weights_only=True or should end with \".keras\" when checkpoint saving the whole model (default). For example: if filepath is \"{epoch:02d}-{val_loss:.2f}.keras\", then the model checkpoints will be saved with the epoch number and the validation loss in the filename. The directory of the filepath should not be reused by any other callbacks to avoid conflicts.\n",

If save_best_only=True, the decision to overwrite the current save file is made based on either the maximization or the minimization of the monitored quantity.

Note that if the saving isn't aligned to epochs, the monitored metric may potentially be less reliable (it could reflect as little as 1 batch, since the metrics get reset every epoch).
