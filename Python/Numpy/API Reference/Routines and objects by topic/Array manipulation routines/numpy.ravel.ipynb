Note that the ‘C’ and ‘F’ options take no account of the memory layout of the underlying array, and only refer to the order of axis indexing. ‘A’ means to read the elements in Fortran-like index order if a is Fortran contiguous in memory, C-like order otherwise. ‘K’ means to read the elements in the order they occur in memory, except for reversing the data when strides are negative. By default, ‘C’ index order is used.\n",

    "\n",
    "In row-major, C-style order, in two dimensions, the row index varies the slowest, and the column index the quickest. This can be generalized to multiple dimensions, where row-major order implies that the index along the first axis varies slowest, and the index along the last quickest. The opposite holds for column-major, Fortran-style index ordering.\n",

    "When a view is desired in as many cases as possible, arr.reshape(-1) may be preferable. However, ravel supports K in the optional order argument while reshape does not."
