    "There are several common variants of the array variance calculation. Assuming the input a is a one-dimensional NumPy array and mean is either provided as an argument or computed as a.mean(), NumPy computes the variance of an array as:\n",
    "\n",
    "N = len(a)\n",
    "d2 = abs(a - mean)**2  # abs is for complex `a`\n",
    "var = d2.sum() / (N - ddof)  # note use of `ddof`\n",
    "\n",
    "Different values of the argument ddof are useful in different contexts. NumPy’s default ddof=0 corresponds with the expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "which is sometimes called the “population variance” in the field of statistics because it applies the definition of variance to a as if a were a complete population of possible observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many other libraries define the variance of an array differently, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, the resulting quantity is sometimed called the “sample variance” because if a is a random sample from a larger population, this calculation provides an unbiased estimate of the variance of the population. The use of\n",
    "\n",
    "in the denominator is often called “Bessel’s correction” because it corrects for bias (toward lower values) in the variance estimate introduced when the sample mean of a is used in place of the true mean of the population. For this quantity, use ddof=1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for complex numbers, the absolute value is taken before squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.\n",
    "\n",
    "For floating-point input, the variance is computed using the same precision the input has. Depending on the input data, this can cause the results to be inaccurate, especially for float32 (see example below). Specifying a higher-accuracy accumulator using the dtype keyword can alleviate this issue."
